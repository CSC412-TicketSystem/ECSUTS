# ECSU Online Maintenance Ticketing System (OMTS)

ECSU students have to report dormitory maintenance issues through word of mouth or with pencil and paper without any updates on the status of their report. Our goal is to build an online maintenance ticket system for ECSU students
to report maintenance problems and view the status of completion in real time.

Visit our page to learn more about the process of making the OMTS [HERE](https://ecsu-maintenance-system.github.io)
